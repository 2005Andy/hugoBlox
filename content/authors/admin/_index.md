## About Me
I’m an undergraduate majoring in **Engineering Mechanics** at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)**.
My academic interests span computational mechanics, multibody dynamics, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), and the application of artificial-intelligence techniques to mechanics research.
I enjoy leveraging C++ and CUDA to accelerate particle-based simulations and writing Python tools that visualise and analyse results.
Beyond academics, I stay active by running, keep a close eye on the stock market, and relax with music.
